Just a smidge of extra pressure came to bear yesterday as the teams had to present their week two project a day early and to a particularly daunting audience. Stephan Fowler is a Senior Developer at Guardian News & Media and a very canny customer, and given that the project is actually a recruitment test for the Guardian he's seen it executed by some of the best coders in the country. Team GetYourCodeOn blew us all away with the first presentation, Stefan was gobsmacked and struggled to find a constructive criticism!
